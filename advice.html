	<ul class=points>
		<li class=item>Career fairs: talk to as many companies as you can.</li>
		<li class=item>Resumes: submit them to all available positions, since you never know who will respond.  Prepare for a lack of responses at first, but eventually someone will reach out.</li>
		<li class=item>Keep a planner or put your assignments in a calender, and setup specific times to do homework.</li>
